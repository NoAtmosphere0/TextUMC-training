Douglas , Sutton , Callan , Dawtry , & Harvey , 2016 ) , and to have low level of analytic thinking ( Swami , Voracek , Stieger , Tran , & Furnham , 2014 ) .\\n Further , some research suggest that conspiracy theory may perform certain function for the self , allow people to regain a sense of control ( van Prooijen & Acker , 2015 ;

van Prooijen & Jostmann , 2013 ; van Prooijen & van Dijk , 2014 , for similar procedure ) .\\n This bogus newspaper article be sufficiently ambiguous to enable participant to believe it could be the result of a conspiracy .\\n The article be design such that it could potentially raise suspicion about a conspiracy ( e .\\n Belief in a Conspiracy TheoryOur main hypothesis be that the manipulation of need for uniqueness should induce a high level of adherence to a conspiracy theory in the individuality condition than in the conformity condition .\\n Although the effect find in this study be only marginal , it suggest that the tendency to believe in a conspiracy can be influence by the need for uniqueness .\\n Belief in a Conspiracy TheoryHowever , another independent sample t-test on the belief in a conspiracy theory measure confirm our prediction that participant in the “ different be well ” condition have a high level of conspiracy belief ( M = 5 .\\n We again find that participant in the need for uniqueness condition have marginally high level of belief in the conspiracy theory .\\n General DiscussionThe purpose of this paper be to empirically test the proposition that conspiracy belief can serve a a mean to satisfy people ’ s need for uniqueness .\\n In Study 2 , we use a correlational design to demonstrate that participant with high need for uniqueness believe more in conspiracy theory .\\n Our finding can also be connect to recent research demonstrating that individual narcissism , or a grandiose idea of the self , be positively relate to belief in conspiracy theory ( Cichocka et al .',\n",

.\\n Is there any way to combat conspiracy theory once they 're out there ? .\\n Douglas have spend more than a decade study conspiracy theory , and she join u to talk about their history , cause , and consequence .\\n What count a a conspiracy theory ? .\\n I give a few example in the introduction , but how do you define conspiracy theory in your research ? .\\n Well , a conspiracy theory can normally be define a a propose plot carry out in secret , usually by a powerful group of people who have some kind of sinister goal .\\n Believing in conspiracy theory and be suspicious about the action of others be in some way quite an adaptive thing to do .\\n And in term of how we measure the extent to which people believe in conspiracy theory , you can do this in a variety of different way .\\n And a a social psychologist now , we would normally measure a belief in conspiracy theory by simply ask people question about the extent to which they endorse a particular idea or the extent to which they believe a particular statement be true .\\n And another way to tap into what some would argue be an underlying tendency to just believe conspiracy theory more generally .\\n And I guess time will tell if conspiracy theory have I guess , be on the rise in this particular point in time compare to time in the past or time in the future .\\n So it 's really difficult to tell , but it do make sense to me that there would have be particular period in history that conspiracy theory would have be more prominent .\\n Let 's talk a little bit about the psychological factor that motivate people to believe in conspiracy theory .\\n And some psychological evidence suggest that people be draw to conspiracy theory when they do feel uncertain either in specific situation or more generally .\\n And there be other epistemic reason why people believe in conspiracy theory as well in relation to this sort of need for knowledge and certainty .\\n And so reach to conspiracy theory might , I guess , at least allow people to feel that they have information that at least explains why they do n't have any control over this situation .\\n But yes , narcissism at an individual level have be associate in quite a few study now with belief in conspiracy theory .\\n So yes , narcissism be one of those individual difference , variable that correlate with belief in conspiracy theory .\\n Do you see any association between those and tendency to believe in conspiracy theory ? .\\n Another of your study find that people who believe in one conspiracy theory be more likely to believe in others , even when those theory directly contradict each other .\\n Obviously we kind of , I guess , start from the point that in the literature it 's often be find that if people believe in one conspiracy theory , then they 're likely to believe in others .\\n We think people would not entertain these two conspiracy theory at the same time , but it turn out that they do , or at least they be prepare to entertain the idea that both of those thing might be true .\\n But we also measure the extent to which people believe in , I guess , an underlying conspiracy theory that something just be n't right .\\n And what we find be that some people do indeed endorse these contradictory conspiracy theory , or again , at least be likely to entertain those two idea at the same time .\\n It 's very true that some conspiracy theory stand the test of time and others just disappear .\\n I think that there must be certain feature of conspiracy theory , the one that last and the one that do n't .\\n Is there any way to effectively debunk a conspiracy theory once it 's out there ? .\\n How do you address conspiracy theory ? .\\n So , be there a way for people to balance this awareness with a healthy skepticism of conspiracy theory ? .\\n So , what aspects of conspiracy theory be you look at today ?

Douglas , Sutton , Callan , Dawtry , & Harvey , 2016 ) , and to have low level of analytic thinking ( Swami , Voracek , Stieger , Tran , & Furnham , 2014 ) .\\n Further , some research suggest that conspiracy theory may perform certain function for the self , allow people to regain a sense of control ( van Prooijen & Acker , 2015 ; Whitson & Galinsky , 2008 ) , order ( van Harreveld , Rutjens , Schneider , Nohlen , & Keskinis , 2014 ) , power ( Gray , 2010 ; Sapountzis & Condor , 2013 ) , and to relieve death anxiety ( Newheiser , Farias , & Tausch , 2011 ) .\\n The current research aim to further contribute to current knowledge about the personal need that may be satisfy by conspiracy belief .\\n Among the self-related motivation that could influence belief in conspiracy theory , we will argue that the need for uniqueness should play a role in people ’ s adherence to conspiracy theory .\\n More specifically , our general claim be that people with a high need for uniqueness should be more likely to believe in conspiracy theory .\\n OverviewIn the current research , we test the overarch hypothesis that the desire to feel unique should foster belief in conspiracy theory .\\n Thus , in Study 1 , we test whether people who endorse conspiracy theory be more likely to think that they possess scarce and secret information about various conspiracy theory .\\n Hence , in Study 2 , we test whether people with a high need for uniqueness also believe in conspiracy theory to a large extent .\\n Of course , it could be that people believe in conspiracy theory without have information about them .\\n Study 2After establish in Study 1 that belief in conspiracy theory could serve the purpose of feel unique , the goal of Study 2 be to directly test whether people with a chronic high need for uniqueness believe in conspiracy theory to a large extent .\\n without mention the expression “ conspiracy theory .\\n Results and DiscussionWe first test our main prediction , that people with a high need for uniqueness should have a high level of belief in conspiracy theory .\\n In line with this hypothesis and with our preliminary work , we find that a high need for uniqueness ( measure by the Self-Attributed Need for Uniqueness scale ) be associate with high belief in conspiracy theory ( measure with the Generic Conspiracist Beliefs scale ) , r ( 206 ) = .\\n Then , we test the relationship between the three underlie factor of need for uniqueness and conspiracy belief ( both linear and quadratic regression ) .\\n To avoid the use of too many statistical test , we combine our two measure of belief in conspiracy theory ( i .\\n Among these test , only one test be significant for this threshold , namely the positive linear relationship between the desire to not always follow rule and belief in conspiracy theory , r ( 206 ) = .\\n Theoretically , this effect be consistent with the stereotypical picture of the “ out from the crowd ” believer in conspiracy theory .\\n To test this hypothesis , after prim need for uniqueness , we measure belief in a ( potentially ) newly form conspiracy theory ( see Bost & Prunier , 2013 ; van Prooijen & Jostmann , 2013 ; van Prooijen & van Dijk , 2014 , for similar procedure ) .\\n This bogus newspaper article be sufficiently ambiguous to enable participant to believe it could be the result of a conspiracy .\\n The article be design such that it could potentially raise suspicion about a conspiracy ( e .\\n Belief in a Conspiracy TheoryOur main hypothesis be that the manipulation of need for uniqueness should induce a high level of adherence to a conspiracy theory in the individuality condition than in the conformity condition .\\n Although the effect find in this study be only marginal , it suggest that the tendency to believe in a conspiracy can be influence by the need for uniqueness .\\n Belief in a Conspiracy TheoryHowever , another independent sample t-test on the belief in a conspiracy theory measure confirm our prediction that participant in the “ different be well ” condition have a high level of conspiracy belief ( M = 5 .\\n We again find that participant in the need for uniqueness condition have marginally high level of belief in the conspiracy theory .\\n General DiscussionThe purpose of this paper be to empirically test the proposition that conspiracy belief can serve a a mean to satisfy people ’ s need for uniqueness .\\n In Study 2 , we use a correlational design to demonstrate that participant with high need for uniqueness believe more in conspiracy theory .\\n Our finding can also be connect to recent research demonstrating that individual narcissism , or a grandiose idea of the self , be positively relate to belief in conspiracy theory ( Cichocka et al .', embedding=array([-0.04608  , -0.006844 , -0.1619   , -0.3167   , -0.1271   ,\n",

.\\n Is there any way to combat conspiracy theory once they 're out there ? .\\n Douglas have spend more than a decade study conspiracy theory , and she join u to talk about their history , cause , and consequence .\\n What count a a conspiracy theory ? .\\n I give a few example in the introduction , but how do you define conspiracy theory in your research ? .\\n Well , a conspiracy theory can normally be define a a propose plot carry out in secret , usually by a powerful group of people who have some kind of sinister goal .\\n Believing in conspiracy theory and be suspicious about the action of others be in some way quite an adaptive thing to do .\\n And in term of how we measure the extent to which people believe in conspiracy theory , you can do this in a variety of different way .\\n And a a social psychologist now , we would normally measure a belief in conspiracy theory by simply ask people question about the extent to which they endorse a particular idea or the extent to which they believe a particular statement be true .\\n And another way to tap into what some would argue be an underlying tendency to just believe conspiracy theory more generally .\\n And I guess time will tell if conspiracy theory have I guess , be on the rise in this particular point in time compare to time in the past or time in the future .\\n So it 's really difficult to tell , but it do make sense to me that there would have be particular period in history that conspiracy theory would have be more prominent .\\n Let 's talk a little bit about the psychological factor that motivate people to believe in conspiracy theory .\\n And some psychological evidence suggest that people be draw to conspiracy theory when they do feel uncertain either in specific situation or more generally .\\n And there be other epistemic reason why people believe in conspiracy theory as well in relation to this sort of need for knowledge and certainty .\\n And so reach to conspiracy theory might , I guess , at least allow people to feel that they have information that at least explains why they do n't have any control over this situation .\\n But yes , narcissism at an individual level have be associate in quite a few study now with belief in conspiracy theory .\\n So yes , narcissism be one of those individual difference , variable that correlate with belief in conspiracy theory .\\n Do you see any association between those and tendency to believe in conspiracy theory ? .\\n Another of your study find that people who believe in one conspiracy theory be more likely to believe in others , even when those theory directly contradict each other .\\n Obviously we kind of , I guess , start from the point that in the literature it 's often be find that if people believe in one conspiracy theory , then they 're likely to believe in others .\\n We think people would not entertain these two conspiracy theory at the same time , but it turn out that they do , or at least they be prepare to entertain the idea that both of those thing might be true .\\n But we also measure the extent to which people believe in , I guess , an underlying conspiracy theory that something just be n't right .\\n And what we find be that some people do indeed endorse these contradictory conspiracy theory , or again , at least be likely to entertain those two idea at the same time .\\n It 's very true that some conspiracy theory stand the test of time and others just disappear .\\n I think that there must be certain feature of conspiracy theory , the one that last and the one that do n't .\\n Is there any way to effectively debunk a conspiracy theory once it 's out there ? .\\n How do you address conspiracy theory ? .\\n So , be there a way for people to balance this awareness with a healthy skepticism of conspiracy theory ? .\\n So , what aspects of conspiracy theory be you look at today ? .\\n I 'm really interested in , I guess , the deliberate use of conspiracy theory a a political device .\\n So , I 've be do some research , I guess , look at how people perceive others who seem to use conspiracy theory , and whether or not they see those action a intentional or deliberate , and also what the effect be of that .\\n I 've also be interested in the term conspiracy theory itself and the term conspiracy theorist and how people use those term , whether they use them to , I guess , specifically put down other people 's idea , or if they simply use these term when they just do n't believe .\", embedding=array([-1.9690e-01, -1.3475e-03, -2.2913e-01, -2.9517e-01, -5.4016e-02,\n",
